# Configure your AWS CLI

This step is so you have the authorization to create an S3 bucket in your AWS account from the command line.

```bash
aws configure
```

It will then ask for some credentials:

```bash

AWS Access Key ID: [ENTER YOUR ACCESS KEY]
AWS Secret Access Key: [ENTER YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY]
Default region name: [ENTER YOUR PREFERRED REGION NAME]
Default output format: json

```
