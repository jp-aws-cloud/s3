# Configure your AWS CLI

This step is so you have the authorization to create an S3 bucket in your AWS account from the command line.

```bash
aws configure
```

It will then ask for some credentials:

```bash

AWS Access Key ID: [ENTER YOUR ACCESS KEY]
AWS Secret Access Key: [ENTER YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY]
Default region name: [ENTER YOUR PREFERRED REGION NAME]
Default output format: json

```

## Create your S3 bucket

On the command line:

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket yourdomain.com --region eu-west-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-1
```

Note that we’ve named the bucket after the domain name we want to use. Replace ‘yourdomain.com’ with whatever domain you want to have your app at. Also, replace ‘eu-west-1’ with your own preferred region.

## Enable S3 bucket static website hosting
On the command line:

```bash
aws s3 website s3://yourdomain.com/ --index-document index.html --error-document index.html
```
Note that here we are also setting the index and error documents of our S3 static hosting bucket. For this example we have set them both to the NUXT index page (index.html) but in the future you may want to change the --error-document to an actual error page.


## Enable S3 bucket versioning
On the command line:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket yourdomain.com --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

```
## Create an S3 Policy to upload to S3 bucket
This allows your S3 bucket to be accessed via a public URL.

In your local directory create a JSON file called policy.json and add the following:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yourdomain.com/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then add the policy to your bucket from the command line:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket yourdomain.com --policy file://policy.json
```

### AWS S3: Bucket Policy vs. Access Control List (ACL)

Securing the objects stored in Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is crucial for protecting sensitive data. When it comes to implementing access control, there are two commonly used methods: Bucket Policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs). These mechanisms allow administrators to define fine-grained permissions for their S3 buckets and the objects within. In this blog post, we will explore the differences between Bucket Policies and ACLs, how they function, and when it’s appropriate to use each.

#### Bucket Policies
A Bucket Policy is a JSON-based access policy that can be attached to an S3 bucket. It allows you to define access permissions at the bucket level and control who can perform specific actions on the objects within the bucket. Bucket Policies are commonly used to provide cross-account access, set up IP-based restrictions, and manage access for AWS services like CloudFront.

#### Anatomy of a Bucket Policy
A Bucket Policy consists of a set of statements, where each statement defines a specific permission or condition. The key components of a Bucket Policy statement include:

- Principal: Specifies the AWS account or IAM user/group to which the statement applies.
- Effect: Determines whether the statement allows or denies access.
- Action: Defines the specific S3 actions that are allowed or denied.
- Resource: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the targeted S3 bucket or object.
- Condition: Optional element that allows you to further refine access based on factors such as IP ranges or request headers.

### Use Cases for Bucket Policies
Bucket Policies are best suited for scenarios that require fine-grained access control at the bucket level. Here are some common use cases:

- Cross-account access: With Bucket Policies, you can grant or deny access to specific AWS accounts, allowing other accounts to perform actions on your bucket or its objects.
- IP-based restrictions: You can use Bucket Policies to restrict access to your bucket from specific IP addresses or ranges.
- Access control for AWS services: Bucket Policies can be leveraged to allow AWS services, such as CloudFront, to directly access your S3 bucket.


```json
// Examples
// Granting read access to a specific AWS account:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "GrantReadAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:root"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
In this example, the Bucket Policy grants read access to a specific AWS account identified by its account ID. The Principal element specifies the account using its ARN (Amazon Resource Name). The Action element is set to s3:GetObject, allowing the account to retrieve objects from the bucket. The Resource element defines the ARN of the bucket and specifies that the permission applies to all objects in the bucket.

```json
// Denying write access to a specific IP range:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyWriteAccess",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "192.168.0.0/24"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
In this example, the Bucket Policy denies write access to a specific IP range. The Principal element is set to *, meaning the policy applies to all AWS accounts. The Action element is set to s3:PutObject, which allows writing objects to the bucket. The Resource element defines the ARN of the bucket and specifies that the permission applies to all objects in the bucket. The Condition element restricts access to requests originating from the IP range 192.168.0.0/24.
